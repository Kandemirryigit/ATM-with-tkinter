# ATM-with-tkinter

<h1>Explanation</h1>
-Hey everyone,I wanted to create an ATM app by tkinter in Python.In this project I can't read any card because of that I created variables.For example: default money in the bank is 1000 TRY,the password is 1903.Of course this features is different for every card but in this program I can't read any card because of that I wanted to creat this simulation.
